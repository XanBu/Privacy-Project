        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name is Xander. For school I was assigned to do a project on what interested me. I was not sure, though
            after a little bit of digging I ran across Privacy Online. It interested me because I had no idea about it,
            nor did anyone else I talked to. I relized that was a probolom, and thus my project was born. I decided I
            would try to help educate people on just a small portion of it, but make a diffrence some way. </p>
